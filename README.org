* Session-Control
  Session-Control is supplementary [[https://github.com/fukamachi/lack][Lack]] middleware for controlling
  =lack.middleware.session= sessions. This middleware provides
  functions for controlling the session from inside a lack app.

  /Beta Warning: still in development, APIs may change. This module
  currently relies on fixes to lack that are not yet in upstream./

* Usage
  Just include =session-control:*session-control-middleware*= in the
  middleware stack:
  : (lack:builder
  :   :session
  :   *session-control-middleware*
  :   *app*)

  Note that Session-Control needs to come after the session
  middleware, since it inspects and modifies the environment values
  that middleware creates.

  Calling =(destroy-session)= will now cause the session to be
  destroyed and the session cookie to be expired; calling
  =(change-session-id)= will cause the current session to be given a
  new id (also updating the client's session cookie).
